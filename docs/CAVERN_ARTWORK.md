# Cavern artwork review

These are intentional port artwork improvements, not recovered game rules.
Keep imported native resources untouched; bake approved pixel edits into the
source-hash-checked, level/room/placement-specific retouch atlas.

## Continuous wall and shadow joins

The user approved level4 room12's left V5 and right V3 on 2026-10-26. The
combined image changes791 native pixels in six background sprite placements.
Foreground columns, silhouettes, transparency and actor masks are unchanged.
The integrated render's RGB SHA256 is
`531028e35010c0fda94c7a6b20b9f89f2169f37f0a13bca7dae7d620faf92059`.

For future rooms with the same problem, use this approved visual approach:

- Continue the upper wall's texture and lighting through the junction. Merely
  feathering the outline of a differently lit rectangle leaves a visible patch.
- Follow the actual column contour. Where the column narrows, the newly
  exposed background also needs the continuation; a fixed vertical strip can
  miss it and leave a bright rectangular lower section.
- Retain local texture, the native pixel grid and palette. In this case the
  upper lighting profile was extended relative to the column edge, preserving
  local texture variation and grading into the lower shadow. No rectangular
  donor texture was pasted and the foreground column was not blurred.
- Confine changes to the affected join and compare both the whole room and
  enlarged detail. Keep previously approved neighboring artwork identical.

The room12 previews and pixel-edit scripts remain local under the existing
art-review worktree's ignored `rendered/level4-room12-shadow-v*/` outputs.
V1-V4 are intermediate proposals; V5 is the approved combined image. Future
matching cases should start from this method rather than repeat the rejected
outline-only treatment. Present the resulting local preview for art review
before committing a new room's artwork.

## Level4 room23: preserve V1 detail and fade the marked join

The user approved room23 V9 on 2026-10-26. It retains V1's wall texture and
stalactite colours, adding only a narrow gradient at the marked vertical join.
The lower dark side's added brightness is limited to avoid a continuous light
stripe. The final render changes2035 pixels from the native room in two
source-checked sprite placements: background3550 and foreground rock face3541.
The rock face's colours change locally; transparency, silhouette, actor masks
and physical columns remain unchanged. The integrated render's RGB SHA256 is
`f4a72ba65bba70226a882dcb4cb9394e1e85b8dc688340ccd5aca5a2dfdbe68a`.

Some grey areas are part of the stalactites' modelling. Broad grey recolouring
and dark-patch removal made the relief less legible and were rejected. Preserve
this detail when treating similar joins: follow the user's marked boundary,
compare the neighbouring rock in context, and avoid turning the gradient into
a bright rim. Do not classify all grey or dark pixels as dirt to remove.

V1 and V9 are the relevant reference images; the intermediate cleanup variants
are not part of the approved result. Local previews remain under the working
tree's ignored `rendered/level4-room23-shadow-v*/` directories.

## Level4 room22: gradient behind the column

The user approved room22 V1 on 2026-10-26. Two source-checked background crops
(SHAP3550 and3518) grade the marked colour discontinuity behind the left column.
The213 changed native pixels are confined to X37..42/Y259..317. The actual
foreground column, its outline, transparency and actor masks stay intact;
the existing doorway blend is preserved. This is a baked native-palette pixel
gradient, not an overlay or an RGB blur. The combined render's RGB SHA256 is
`74912e7249bf2e288597df09ca426527045adc8cc55a9e75c0883408060cde16`.
The exit animation retains the same local correction. Local review images
remain under `rendered/level4-room22-shadow-v1/`.

## Level4 final batch: rooms5,14,26 and28

The user approved these four rooms individually, then approved integration of
the complete batch on 2026-10-27. Seventeen additional source-checked crops
apply only to these level4 placements. Earlier atlas crops remain unchanged.

| Room | Approved version | Changed native pixels | Render RGB SHA256 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | V1 | 382 | `421ee7b40f740af3598ef7d1c3b8acf5ba6a5b4fd4394a2a684ed017f53d5290` |
| 14 | V1 | 608 | `6c545e48efa6fde6a208453d89c3bd5785bdb9fcf1bdee055d086521553c7933` |
| 26 | V4 | 481 | `9ef82c6d26f7540b12e655ed87dcebaf0ab4f3ba810f609ac75d0735ab096197` |
| 28 | V3 | 336 | `d60832d8900669a315a5868ea9d069755f5b330f4c12b5618e6567578c8e1d63` |

Room5 continues the matching approved room12 lighting. Room14 grades a wider
shadow beside its upper column. In room26, follow the widening column contour
and continue the accepted upper gradient gradually into the lower rim; resetting
the shading at a fixed row produced a rejected horizontal cut. The lit column
bodies retain their original pixels. Only their outer dark shadow fringe may
change colour; alpha, silhouettes and actor masks stay identical.

Room28 preserves its foreground completely. The right-hand circle in the first
reference indicated an area, not a contour to trace: the requested gradient is
across the vertical background join beside the stalactite. V3 also softens the
small squared shadow shoulder below it. Keep the approved left join unchanged
while revising the right. All four use the native palette and pixel grid, with
local texture retained rather than blurred. Local previews and the approval
manifest remain under ignored `rendered/level4-art-batch/` and the corresponding
`rendered/level4-room*-shadow-v*/` folders.

## Level5 final batch: eight approved rooms

The user approved room17 V2 and closed the cavern-artwork review on2026-10-27.
Forty-one room/placement-specific crops reproduce the eight approved images,
changing9497 visible native pixels across the review states below. Earlier
level3/4 crops and doorway blends remain unchanged. Imported resources stay
untouched, and the runtime's native-artwork opt-out remains available.

| Room | Version | Changed pixels | Render RGB SHA256 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | V2 | 2747 | `2ef93b2f6a12554f9f77acc4b07a523187769454c65eab587417dbebeb805eae` |

Room7's approval shows the stone gate fully open (`pressure_key=(46,0,0)`). Its
wide gradient belongs exclusively to the two static wall pieces, not the gate;
the same local artwork must remain correct throughout the gate's movement.
Rooms6,15,16 and25 follow the actual widening column contours. Only their outer
dark shadow fringe may recolour; lit column bodies and silhouettes stay native.
Room25's right-hand lower wall was explicitly left unchanged.

Rooms6 and17 reuse the approved room1 level3 wall behind their own foreground
columns. A source-checked crop can still expose a previously hidden edge in a
different placement: this produced a thin dark stroke at X396 in room6 and
X192 in room17. Their final approved versions remove those introduced strokes.
Room17 restores its exposed right margin exactly to native pixels. The last
three colour columns of the neighboring foreground rock faces may grade
locally, as approved; physical foreground columns remain exact.

All edits retain the native palette and pixel grid. Transparency, retained
pixels, actor occlusion, climbing/floor redraw masks and moving-gate masks
are unchanged. Gradients are baked into the bundled atlas and applied when
building cached room images, not recomputed pixel by pixel each frame.
Local approvals and baking reports remain under ignored
`rendered/level5-art-review/`. README comparison selection is a separate user
decision; this artwork review does not replace its wording.
